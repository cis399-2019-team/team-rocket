For our final project, we will be installing the emacs package.
The primary reason we opted to install emacs on our system is because of its populularity and practicality as a text editor. 
We want each user (classmate) to have the ability to work on their editor of choice if they were to use their account to work on a project.

Goals:
1 - Install emacs so that every user has access to use it
2 - Give users the permissions to install emacs extensions to fit their needs

In order to verify the success of these goals, we will coordinate with classmates to ensure that emacs is installed and they are able to install extensions. 


Emacs would likely not cause any issues for the general user population, as they will still have the option to use vi or vim should they choose. 


Security Issues:
1 - We need to ensure that while the users have permissions to install extensions for emacs, they dont have the permissions to install other software packages
2 - With users installing their own extensions, it is possible an extension could cause an insecurity. 

Installing emacs itself does not appear to be difficult and it likely only requires a few lines of puppet code. The challenging part lies in establishing user permissions,
identifying issues as they arise, and automating tasks that ensure users are not installing faulty extensions. One solution that may need to be implemented, is installing
another package capable of approving extensions before they are installed. Further research will need to be done to determine if this is possible
