This is a brief documentation explaining how we installed packages for Emacs using apt 

1 - To search for Emacs packages, enter "apt-cache search emacs"

	* this provides a list of all available packages for emacs

2 - To install desired package, enter "apt-get install <packageName>"

	* Ex:	apt-get install python-mode

Most of the packages we have installed relate to Python as our target audience for our users is programmers. There are other interesting and useful
packages we could install down the line to make Emacs more powerful and useful.
